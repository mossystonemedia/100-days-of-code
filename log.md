# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Research on what, exactly, #100daysofcode is. Signed up for Gitter. Figured out where I am in Free Code Camp. Learned online courses usually charge now, even Coursera. Considered signing up for Udemy. Declared challenge acceptance on Twitter. 

**Thoughts:** Funny, initial entry for this didn't work because I'm still figuring out how to work on GitHub. 

Goals as posted on Twitter:
 1. @FreeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm
 2. @coursera - Python  
 3. Accessibility? Data management? Find a reason to code.

Goals after research:
1. Build weather page (or app?)
2. Link weather data, sunrise/sunset, and aurora forecast -- with some design, make something that shows when it's good for photography in one's area
3. If time, create map graphic on Mossy Stone Media website that links different stories from my portfolio to their place of origin. 
4. When in doubt, continue on in Free Code Camp -- preferably to end of Basic Algorithm Scripting. 
5. Still gotta find that reason to code.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Research on what, exactly, #100daysofcode is. Signed up for Gitter. Figured out where I am in Free Code Camp. Learned online courses usually charge now, even Coursera. Considered signing up for Udemy. Declared challenge acceptance on Twitter. 

**Thoughts:** Funny, initial entry for this didn't work because I'm still figuring out how to work on GitHub. 

Goals as posted on Twitter:
 1. @FreeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm
 2. @coursera - Python  
 3. Accessibility? Data management? Find a reason to code.

Goals after research:
1. Build weather page (or app?)
2. Link weather data, sunrise/sunset, and aurora forecast -- with some design, make something that shows when it's good for photography in one's area
3. If time, create map graphic on Mossy Stone Media website that links different stories from my portfolio to their place of origin. 
4. When in doubt, continue on in Free Code Camp -- preferably to end of Basic Algorithm Scripting. 
5. Still gotta find that reason to code.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Like a toddler, stumbled through the web into various data-related information in hopes of finding a way to build a single-page weather app. 
- To avoid "repeat after me" learning, researched NOAA weather data API, but did find a good 4.5-hour course on the subject if I want to use JSON (A JavaScript subset we learn further down the road in FCC) 
- Read GitHub's "Hello world" tutorial

**Thoughts:** 
Warning: Stream of consciousness
- Learned APIs make smaller building blocks into bigger building blocks so it's easier for programmers to assemble something more complex. 
- Learned about data.gov , data set to pull from would probably be METAR and CDR, but METAR is no longer operational
- It's as if I'm drunkenly wandering from new term to new term. I don't want to look up "how to make a weather app" and just copy the code. So the data I'm getting most often from official sources is XML, which seems to need to be parsed, which can be done into javascript here: http://debeissat.nicolas.free.fr/sax.php ... may be important down the line
- https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-weather-app Aaaah! ... AAAAAAH!! 
- More Weather API - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/noaa-national-weather-service-nws
- Going to see how far I can get with the ten minutes left, not sure I'm ready for JSON. http://xml.silmaril.ie/ is a great FAQ for working with XML 
- Codepen.io -- for bigger operations, free accounts let you save what's interesting to check out later. 

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Couple of FCC lessons - math operations in JavaScript, included Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
- Rough look at programming my web app might need. So far, JSON nested in HTML for location, JS for Fahrenheit-Celsius Converter
- Wrote out pseudocode for what I want to do. 

**Thoughts**
- Realized [this inspiring post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645#.ro3w4nc1q) even uses a weather app as an example

### Day 4: January 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Ran back to Free Code Camp while I gather my thoughts. 
- Signed up for CodePen, which before seemed like it wasn't available for me, but now is a godsend through FCC.
- Started the FCC tribute page challenge. Decided to do this on Chief Peter John, who meant a lot to our community.

**Thoughts**
- Not knowing where to begin causes a lot of anxiety. 
- Learned servers will be providing XML data through PHP, whereas I will be parsing that information through JSON so it can be read by JavaScript. I think I got that right. 
- [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_php.asp) explains things pretty well, though. 
- Oh, note to self -- [this](https://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/gfs4.html) seemed like a neat NOAA-based source of data

### Day 5: January 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Mostly focused on research for writing portion
- Re-learned there's CSS inline style (such as inserting style="font-size:.5em" on an HTML tag), which is what I'm looking for when not wanting to define style through a sheet or in the beginning of a header/body. 


**Thoughts**
- Soooo it was PAUL JOHN, not Peter John, about whom I wanted to write. This meant a day of coding that was actually more a day of research and writing, to meet this Free Code Camp requirement. 

### Day 6: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- More research

**Thoughts**
- This is what I run into in my site, too -- very little actual coding, most of the work is in the populating. 

### Day 7: January 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Add later

**Thoughts**


### Day 8: January 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Add later

### Day 9: January 15, 2017

### Day 10: January 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Resurrected portfolio spreadsheet to start populating
- Linked bootstrap, making things gorgeous.
- First attempt at making fluid container to house honeycomb
**Thoughts**
- Reminded of wells, buttons using Bootstrap, jQuery -- may be useful for honeycomb array. Bootstrap uses jQuery? Good for rows
- Need to do a primer on container-fluid for these kinds of buttons
- col-xs, col-sm, col-lg in div container means the number of columns in mobile, tablet, desktop, can be combined as I used in this code from W3 schools. But has to be less than 12

### Day 11: January 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Researched how to make hexagons using CSS

**Thoughts**
- I know we aren't supposed to copy code, but this sort of thing didn't come up in my lessons (closest thing was the border-radius trick), so... I learned the answer usually has to do with three shapes and transparencies. 
- However, simpler code uses a polygon function and webkit, so I looked into webkit. Sounds like it's an engine used by safari, chrome, but nothing else. So not fair to use IMO.
- [Clippy](http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) is amazing. But prefix links back to webkit. 
- [SVG clip-path includes firefox, not IE.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/creating-responsive-shapes-with-clip-path/)

### Day 12??? January 23, 2017

Wow, I didn't think I had taken 6 days off from this, have to double check this.

**Today's progress**
- Figured out how I want to arrange pages on Mossy Stone Media, going to be spending this time populating my site for a few days.
- Filled in dates, probably have enough to go on for a test run. 

### Day 13: January 28, 2017
**Today's progress**
- Finished one year in my portfolio links, trying to figure out what's up with the product ad and where to remove that. 

**Thoughts**
- Is this going to be worth it if I switch to a hexagon system eventually?

### Day 14: January 29, 2017
**Today's progress**
- Figured out how to delete the sidebar showing up on my Kadence theme from the demo
- Finished Sun Star entries into spreadsheet

**Thoughts**
- Why is my site so dang slow? Should I switch to Google hosting or just streamline this site?

### Day 15: January 31, 2017
**Today's progress**
- Started seeking out blog posts to beef up print side of portfolio. 

**Thoughts**
- Thinking I'm going to divide this into 6 columns so they can match up better, rather than the 3. Then smaller font for outlet and date.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

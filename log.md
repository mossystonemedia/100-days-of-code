# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Research on what, exactly, #100daysofcode is. Signed up for Gitter. Figured out where I am in Free Code Camp. Learned online courses usually charge now, even Coursera. Considered signing up for Udemy. Declared challenge acceptance on Twitter. 

**Thoughts:** Funny, initial entry for this didn't work because I'm still figuring out how to work on GitHub. 

Goals as posted on Twitter:
 1. @FreeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm
 2. @coursera - Python  
 3. Accessibility? Data management? Find a reason to code.

Goals after research:
1. Build weather page (or app?)
2. Link weather data, sunrise/sunset, and aurora forecast -- with some design, make something that shows when it's good for photography in one's area
3. If time, create map graphic on Mossy Stone Media website that links different stories from my portfolio to their place of origin. 
4. When in doubt, continue on in Free Code Camp -- preferably to end of Basic Algorithm Scripting. 
5. Still gotta find that reason to code.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Like a toddler, stumbled through the web into various data-related information in hopes of finding a way to build a single-page weather app. 
- To avoid "repeat after me" learning, researched NOAA weather data API, but did find a good 4.5-hour course on the subject if I want to use JSON (A JavaScript subset we learn further down the road in FCC) 
- Read GitHub's "Hello world" tutorial

**Thoughts:** 
Warning: Stream of consciousness
- Learned APIs make smaller building blocks into bigger building blocks so it's easier for programmers to assemble something more complex. 
- Learned about data.gov , data set to pull from would probably be METAR and CDR, but METAR is no longer operational
- It's as if I'm drunkenly wandering from new term to new term. I don't want to look up "how to make a weather app" and just copy the code. So the data I'm getting most often from official sources is XML, which seems to need to be parsed, which can be done into javascript here: http://debeissat.nicolas.free.fr/sax.php ... may be important down the line
- https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-weather-app Aaaah! ... AAAAAAH!! 
- More Weather API - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/noaa-national-weather-service-nws
- Going to see how far I can get with the ten minutes left, not sure I'm ready for JSON. http://xml.silmaril.ie/ is a great FAQ for working with XML 
- Codepen.io -- for bigger operations, free accounts let you save what's interesting to check out later. 

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Couple of FCC lessons - math operations in JavaScript, included Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
- Rough look at programming my web app might need. So far, JSON nested in HTML for location, JS for Fahrenheit-Celsius Converter
- Wrote out pseudocode for what I want to do. 

**Thoughts**
- Realized [this inspiring post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645#.ro3w4nc1q) even uses a weather app as an example
- Found something I needed in my life: [What Fucking Programming Language Should I Use?](http://www.wfplsiu.com)

### Day 4: January 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Ran back to Free Code Camp while I gather my thoughts. 
- Signed up for CodePen, which before seemed like it wasn't available for me, but now is a godsend through FCC.
- Started the FCC tribute page challenge. Decided to do this on Chief Peter John, who meant a lot to our community.

**Thoughts**
- Not knowing where to begin causes a lot of anxiety. 
- Learned servers will be providing XML data through PHP, whereas I will be parsing that information through JSON so it can be read by JavaScript. I think I got that right. 
- [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_php.asp) explains things pretty well, though. 
- Oh, note to self -- [this](https://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/gfs4.html) seemed like a neat NOAA-based source of data
- Links for tribute page (in research process now): [The Gospel According to Peter John](http://ankn.uaf.edu/publications/Books/Peter_John.pdf) [Tanana Chiefs Conference](https://www.tananachiefs.org/about/our-leadership/traditional-chiefs/chief-peter-john/)

### Day 5: January 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Mostly focused on research for writing portion
- Re-learned there's CSS inline style (such as inserting style="font-size:.5em" on an HTML tag), which is what I'm looking for when not wanting to define style through a sheet or in the beginning of a header/body. 


**Thoughts**
- Soooo it was PAUL JOHN, not Peter John, about whom I wanted to write. This meant a day of coding that was actually more a day of research and writing, to meet this Free Code Camp requirement. 

### Day 6: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- More research

**Thoughts**
- This is what I run into in my site, too -- very little actual coding, most of the work is in the populating.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
